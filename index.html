								<strong style="font-size: 25px;">Credit Card Fraud Detection using R</strong>
								<p><p>
								<p>Credit card fraud is the most common type of identity fraud, and businesses are desperate to find a solution to stop the loss it creates. A recent study by Juniper Research has found that retailers are expected to lose $130 billion in digital CNP (Card-not-Present) fraud between 2018 and 2023. Businesses need to be able to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, and machine learning could be a solution.</p>
								<p>This project utilizes the R programming language to examine how machine learning algorithms can be used to predict if a credit card transaction from the data set is fraudulent or not. Multiple data resampling methods will be used on the imbalanced data to train a machine learning model, and the results will be compared. A single resampling method will then be chosen and used on the imbalanced data to fit multiple machine learning models, and the model with the best ROC performance on the test set will be identified. Variable importance for a given model will be determined, which will show which features are the most important predictors for the model. Finally, an ensemble model will be created to combine the predictions of different models. The tools in the caret package will be used to handle the entire process of training, testing, predicting, and comparing the machine learning models in this project.</p>

								<strong style="font-size: 25px;">Predicting Home Prices in Ames, Iowa</strong>
								<p><p>
								<p>Purchasing a home is one of the most important decisions a person can make. By extension, selling a home is also a life-changing decision. Overpaying for a home or undervaluing your home are two critical mistakes that can be financially devastating. No one wants to find out later that they could have asked for a higher price or end up with buyerâ€™s remorse after purchasing a home. Therefore, homebuyers, sellers, and real estate agents need a tool to help them understand how to value a house accurately.</p>
								<p>The dataset for this project required extensive cleaning, as nearly a quarter of the variables had missing values. Additionally, most of the variables were categorical variables that required encoding. With limited domain knowledge, I chose an encoding strategy to bin the variables based on the correlation with the target variable. I was ultimately able to build a robust data model that accurately predicted the price of a home based on key features.</p>

								<strong style="font-size: 25px;">NFL Concussions - A Data Visualization and Storytelling Project</strong>
								<p><p>
								<p>Using NFL Player, Game, and Concussion statistics, this project examines the evolution of the most exciting and dangerous play in the NFL: The Kickoff. The NFL has made changes to the kickoff rules three times since 2011, but the question remains: Have the rule changes since 2011 made the kickoff safer?</p>
								<p>For a quick summary of the analysis, please check out the <a href="https://github.com/DanZylkowski/Data-Visualization-and-Storytelling-Project/blob/main/5.3%20Project%20task%204%20DZylkowski%20Infographic.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>infographic </strong></a> or <a href="https://github.com/DanZylkowski/Data-Visualization-and-Storytelling-Project/blob/main/6.3%20Project%20Presentation%20DZylkowski%20.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>presentation </strong></a> created for this project.

								<strong style="font-size: 25px;">Python Data Engineering Project: Wrangling, Merging, and Visualizing NFL Player and Game data from the years 2017, 2018, and 2019</strong>
								<p><p>
								<p>This project combined data from three different sources, all from the same time period: the years 2017, 2018, and 2019. The first data source is an Excel file of NFL Combine data compiled from <a href="https://nflcombineresults.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.nflcombineresults.com. </a>The second source contains NFL draft data scraped from <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.pro-football-reference.com. </a> The third source contains NFL Fantasy data retrieved from the API of <a href="https://www.fantasyfootballdatapros.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.fantasyfootballdatapros.com.</p>
								<p>After wrangling and cleaning the data sources, each was loaded into Tables in a SQLLite database using the Python SQLAlchemy library. The Tables were then joined in pairs in SQL and loaded back into Python dataframes. Finally, several visualizations were created to explore the relationships between varaibles in the merged data.</p>

								<strong style="font-size: 25px;">Predicting Default of Credit Card Clients</strong>
								<p><p>
								<p>Credit card companies make money by collecting interest on loans. When a customer is unable to pay, then the loan defaults. Defaults cause credit card companies to lose money by either writing the balance off completely, or by selling the balance to a collection agency for pennies on the dollar. Therefore, determining if a customer will default in the next month can allow a bank to implement loss mitigation strategies in advance of the default.</p>
								<p>In this project I used Python to evaluate the performance of six machine learning model frameworks to understand if the dataset has the ability to accurately predict whether a customer will default on their account in the next month. The six models used were Logistic Regression, KNN classifier, Bagging classifier, AdaBoost classifier, XGBoost classifier, and Random forest classifier.</p>

								<strong style="font-size: 25px;">Predicting the Price of Used Cars in the UK</strong>
								<p><p>
								<p>Used cars are the biggest segment of car sales today, as the market is twice as big as the new car sales market and has grown even bigger due to decreased manufacturing of new vehicles during the global pandemic. With increased competition for used cars, it is essential to ensure the consumer is getting a fair value for the automobile being purchased. Understanding the fair price for a used vehicle is beneficial for the dealership as well as the consumer.</p>
								<p>This Project utilized machine learning to examine which features of a car are the most important in determining the price of a vehicle. Several additional features were engineered, and they were used to build a predictive model to accurately estimate the price of the car.</p>

								<strong style="font-size: 25px;">Brain Tumor MRI Classification and Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Image Classification with Keras and Fastai</strong>
								<p><p>
								<p>According to the <a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/annual-cancer-facts-and-figures/2020/cancer-statistics-presentation-2020.pptx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>American Cancer Society </strong></a> estimates, in the year 2021 Lung and Colon cancer will account for approximately 20% of all cancer diagnoses, and approximately 30% of all cancer deaths. Early detection and diagnosis of cancerous tumors are the most critical factors for the successful treatment of cancer. A tumor is an abnormal growth or mass of cells, but not all tumors are cancerous. Medical imaging is one way to identify cancerous tumors, and two common medical imaging methods used are Magnetic Resonance Imaging <a href="https://www.cancer.org/treatment/understanding-your-diagnosis/tests/mri-for-cancer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>(MRI)</strong></a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histopathology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>histopathology</strong></a>.
								<p>This project used three different datasets to determine if deep learning models can be built using Keras and Fastai to accomplish the following:  

    							<ul>
        							<li>Accurately classify <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>brain tumor MRI images</strong></a> into one of four classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, or benign.</li>
        							<li>Accurately classify <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/lung-and-colon-cancer-histopathological-images" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>colon tissue histopathological images</strong></a> as cancerous or benign.</li>
        							<li>Accurately classify <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/lung-and-colon-cancer-histopathological-images" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>lung tissue histopathological images</strong></a> into one of three classes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or benign.</li>

								<strong style="font-size: 25px;">NFL Player Statistical Analysis - Are Modern NFL Players Bigger, Faster, and Stronger?</strong>
								<p><p>
								<p>Every year since 1985, the NFL invites eligible college football players to attend the NFL Scouting Combine. The invitation-only event evaluates players based on size, strength, speed, power, and agility through a series of physical tests. A playerâ€™s performance at the combine can affect their draft status, which affects their earning potential. For some players, the combine represents their last chance at fulfilling their dream of becoming an NFL player. As the NFL has evolved, player positions have become more specialized, which has led to bigger, stronger, and faster players.</p>
								<p>This project will compares the NFL combine results between two time periods: (1987-1999) and (2000-2020) and use various statistical techniques to answer the question: Are Modern NFL Players Bigger, Faster, and Stronger?</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/nfl team logos.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<strong style="font-size: 25px;">NFL Team Logo Image Classification with Keras and Fastai</strong>
								<p><p>
								<p>This project aims to classify the images of the logos of 31 of the 32 NFL teams. The Washington Football Team is not being included in this analysis since the team has no current logo and will not have a new logo until 2022.</p>
								<p>The project has three parts: data collection and cleaning, training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch in Keras, and finally building a model on top of the ResNet50 model using the fastai library. The goal of the project is to create a CNN model that will classify NFL team logo images with high accuracy.</p>
								<p>While the focus of the project is to classify NFL team logos, the project could be used as a template for creating CNN models that can classify other types of images with only slight modifications to the data collection and modeling steps.</p>
